##notes

this is a lot faster than my react or virtual-dom implementations. should probably find out the details. might be a result of putting everything in context instead of scope.

observables everywhere: looks like i can get away with cramming just about everything static in my props, and then the dynamic bit (subscription) goes in constructor. pretty cool, i guess.

wtf is a directive?

75%+ of the time to develop this mess of code was spent learning how to use the templating language.

i don't know how to bundle this up for gh-pages (yet)
